This work is the part of the research at IRT, RWTH Aachen University. We use SteinICP to estimate the uncertainty in scan matching of LiDAR odometry. Later we will integrate it into a factor graph optimization framework. For more details please have a look at [https://github.com/rwth-irt/gnssFGO](url)
